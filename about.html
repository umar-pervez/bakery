        <ul>
            <li>Quality ingredients sourced from local farmers and suppliers</li>
            <li>Artisanal techniques passed down through generations</li>
            <li>A commitment to creativity—our bakers are always dreaming up new flavors</li>
            <li>A warm, welcoming atmosphere where friends become family</li>
        </ul>
